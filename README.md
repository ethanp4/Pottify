# Pottify
Pottify is a music player and library manager written in c# winforms. It automatically organizes your music by the files included metadata (Title, Artist, Album) and displays album artwork. If a file has no / missing metadata it can be edited to your own liking. Pottify also supports creating and adding songs to playlists as well as traditional media controls you would expect from any media player (besides "repeat all")
